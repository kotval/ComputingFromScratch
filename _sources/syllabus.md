  - Web App Basics


# Basic Unix Use

In How Linux Works :cite:`howlinux`

* Read Introduction
* Read Chapter 1. for the basics of the Linux system.
* Read as much of Chatper 2 as you can. You won't learn these commands by reading about them, but it helps to at least seem them all once. Do as much as you can from the bash command line interface (cli). Bash is really a programming language, but it's quite antiquated. We will only use it to write simple bash scripts to glue other programs together.

Commands to practice and remember:
`ls, cd, (cd ..), pwd, mkdir, touch, rm, (packag manager:) pacman -Syu, cat, vim (remember how to exit :wq, insert mode is i, ESC to change mode), man (for manuals)`

# LISP

# C Programming

* Do hacker rank C challenge as often as you can. I will assign specific exercises here as we progress.
* In Effective C :cite:`seacord`, read xxiv-xxv, Chapters 1-5.
* Then read Ch. 6 through Ch. 11 of Effective C. 

# Python Programming

* Basic OOP
* list comprehension
* itertools
* functools (you'll miss lisp fast)
* Numpy and pandas. Yay high level access to numerical computing
* Test driven development
* Web app basics, http, networking, a tiny bit of JS.
